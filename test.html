 I have a female party of a son on the phone
 He is willing to come pick her up
 Or meet somebody at the house
 If he wants to speak with her
 Ok
 Well we are tied up in the middle of the road right now
 She wants to get her bag
 So we are going to transport her bag
 And her back to where
 Back to that residence
